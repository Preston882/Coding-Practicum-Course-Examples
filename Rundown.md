• Course Project
  ○ I decided to make a forums page for my course project, Though it is still in development, I wanted to use Firebase more than I had already been using it. I wanted to get an Idea of how everything works and if It's TRUELY secure.
• Vending Machine
  ○ I am also programming a Vending machine for the school Dobyns-Bennett. I will make files on this repository regarding what I've done and what I need to do.
• MAD
  ○ A separate class called "Mobile app Development" I will be creating mobile apps for developers to communicate with each other, also giving tips and votes on developer projects.
