<h1>• [TribeBytes](/TribeBytes.md)</h1>
  <p> 
  I decided to help improve the current Dobyns-Bennett Tribe-Bytes website by not only inlcuding my own ideas but to also work with real time developers.

<h1>• Vending Machine</h1>
  <p> 
  I am also programming a Vending machine for the school Dobyns-Bennett. I will make files on this repository regarding what I've done and what I need to do.</p>
<h1>• MAD</h1>
 <p> 
  A separate class called "Mobile app Development" I will be creating mobile apps for developers to communicate with each other, also giving tips and votes on developer projects.
</p>
<h1>• Remote work</h1>
  <p>
    During this time, I not only got the opportunity to work and develop my sites/projects from home, but if I had problems I had the ability to come in and ask for that help.

<h1>• Season Tickets app</h1>
  <p>
    As I looked more into coding/developing, I was given the opportunity to develop a seasons tickets app for dobyns-bennett
  </p>
<h1>• Developer Blog</h1>
  <p>
    Once again learning the beginning's of how to be a successful developer, I created a developer blog for the progress I made for that current class. I then took a break from it due to Covid-19 issues and virtual work complications, however, I have recently returned to it as it will be my Online Portfolio.
